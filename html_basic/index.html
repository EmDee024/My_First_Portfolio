    <!-- Level 1 Heading -->
    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>

    <!-- Level 2 Heading -->
    <h2>About This Page</h2>

    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
    <p>
        This is my first official webpage as part of the ALX Front-End program.
        I'm starting small, but the dream is massive — to build clean, modern
        websites and become a world-class developer.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>
        Every great developer started with a simple “Hello World,” and this page
        is my own little beginning. From here, it only gets better.
    </p>

    <!-- Level 3 Heading -->
    <h3>Why I'm Learning This</h3>

    <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
    <p>
        I’m learning front-end development because I want to build amazing digital
        experiences — websites, tools, and platforms that help people and maybe even
        change a few lives along the way.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
    <p>
        This journey is long, but I'm here for it. And this webpage is proof that
        I'm taking the first step, one line of code at a time.
